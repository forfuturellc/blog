> This post introduces **fpush**, a library and terminal tool for
> **pushing files to remote servers** over multiple protocols,
> including (at time of writing) [FTP][ftp] and [SFTP][sftp].
> The library utilizes a **push process** designed to be *interruptible*
> (at a minimal cost) and *protocol-agnostic*.
